# php-mysql-query-api
I created a MySQL API to run queries based on the underlying object params using procedural style MySQLi.

  Writing a class for the MySQL connection and common queries allows the code to be use in many other case.
my main focus is to use this backen to create a database managments system and or Content management system like Wordpress, Drupal ect...
